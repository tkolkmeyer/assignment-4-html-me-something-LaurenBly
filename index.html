                <h2 id="space">Background</h2>
                <p>Why am I telling such a morbid story? Partly because I have dark sense of humor, but also as a way to process how my childhood home is what I'm sure Steven King had in mind when he wrote Pet Semetary. All of our cats and other assorted
                    pets (I'm not going to even get into what other animals we had over the years) were buried around our house and in the backyard. How many cats total did the Bly's have, you ask? After comparing notes with my two older brothers, we
                    estimate that we had at least 18 cats over the span of 18 years. Don't worry, not all of them died terrible deaths. But our house was still pretty much a kitty death house.</p>

                <h2>Jenny</h2>
                <p>Jenny was a Siamese cat, and from what I've been told, she was incredibly smart and loyal. She lived a very long life and passed away when she was 20. See? So far, no terrible deaths.</p>

                <h2>Shane</h2>
                <p>I do not remember this cat at all, but I believe he was also a Siamese cat and also died of old age.</p>

                <h2 id="mainHeading">Thomasina</h2>
                <p>Thomasina probably had the worst death out of all the cats. She got her name from an old Disney movie that I loved to watch, especially whenever I was sick (along with The Princess Bride of course!) Just like in the movie, Thomasina was
                    subjected to being dressed up in clothes that I made for her and pushed around in a pram. She tried to avoid playing dress up and liked to hide and take a nap in the dryer. What you have to understand about this dryer is that the door
                    wasn't secured, so you had to pick the door off the ground to put it on and then take it off entirely when you wanted to open it. My family usually left it off in between use, because they knew Thomasina liked to nap there. Do you
                    see where I'm going with this?...My Mom wasn't paying attention and threw a heavy damp load of laundry into the dryer, quickly secured the door, turned it on and walked away. When she came back an hour later, she found Thomasina. My
                    Dad says that he's never heard my Mom scream like that. My parents didn't tell me what happened for a couple days. Probably because they were traumatized themselves.</p>

                <h2>Sassy</h2>
                <p>Sassy was Squeaker and Sleepy's sister, and she was also a black cat. She had a huge personality and was extremely feisty (hence the name). My brother Ryan found her in the street after she was run over by a car.</p>

                <h2>Squeaker</h2>
                <p>Squeaker was a handsome black cat. He was graceful and loved cuddling. His brother was Sleepy who was also a black cat. About 3 weeks before Halloween one year, Squeaker went missing. He came back a week before Halloween with his stomach
                    shaved. We tried keeping him inside the rest of that month, or at least until after Halloween, but he managed to get out and he never came back. Pretty sure someone who was superstitious or into the occult killed him.</p>

                <a name="hop along"></a>
                <h2>Hop Along</h2>
                <p>Quite possibly one of the meanest cats ever. He was a 3-legged cat (hence the name) whose favorite pastimes were hissing and swatting at anyone who tried to love him. He looked ROUGH because he was originally a streetcat. I don't think
                    I've ever successfully pet him and I have no idea why we kept him as he was more likely to murder us in our sleep than ever cuddle us. Even though Hop-along was a jerk, he still didn't deserve to die the way that he did. There were
                    a bunch of mean kids in our neighborhood that had BB guns; and so one morning we found him shot to death near our rose bush. We never found out who murdered him.</p>

            <section>
                <a name="cuddles"></a>
                <h2>Cuddles</h2>
                <p>Cuddles was a fluffy grey long-haired cat. She was stuck up and prissy and contrary to her name, was never down to cuddle. It was a really cold winter with snow and ice on the ground, and Cuddles didn't come back in at night. The next
                    day we found her near my neighbor's house. We're not sure if she froze to death and then a dog went after her or a dog went after her and her remains froze. We hope it was the first scenario.</p>

                <a name="lovable"></a>
                <h2>Lovable</h2>
                <p>I do not remember Lovable since she died as a kitten, but my Mom still gets really upset about this incident. Apparently Mom named Lovable because she was the sweetest and most interactive kitten from her litter. You know that saying "curiosity
                    killed the cat?". Well curiousity definitely got the best of Lovable. She checked out the back door one day. It was unlocked, so she nudged the door to get into the backyard. Our dogs Rascal and Precious tore her to pieces</p>

                <a name="sleepy"></a>
                <h2>Sleepy</h2>
                <p>Sleepy lived up to his name. He was a sleepy and very chill cat who always wanted to snuggle with you and had these wise eyes. He also snuck into my room and ate my gerbils, but I still loved him despite that incident. Since he was a black
                    cat like his brother Squeaker, he was also catnapped close to Halloween and never came back. </p>

                <h2>Harry</h2>
                <p>Harry was named after the movie "Dirty Harry" because his lip kind of curled up like Clint Eastwood and he had this tough guy persona. Harry got some strange tumor that ate his nose from the inside out and we had to put him down.</p>

                <h2>Mr. Sweetums</h2>
                <p>Funny thing about Mr. Sweetums (besides his name), was that we orginally thought "he" was a "she". So we previously called him "Nina, the Warrior Cat Princess" after Xena the Warrior Princess because of his battlelike cry when he was wrestling
                    with the other cats. I was living abroad in China for a year and I got a phone call at 2am my time from my Dad, who was sobbing. He told me that Mr. Sweetums was on the 2nd floor stair banister, where he liked to perch often, and he
                    lost his balance and DID NOT land on his feet and broke his neck. Dad buried Mr. Sweetums and was so upset that he locked himself out of the house. </p>

                <h2>Smokey</h2>
                <p>Smokey was a handsome blue Russian short hair cat and he never meowed. I think he was depressed or something because he never really played with the other cats or wanted to cuddle, but he wasn't stuck up. Smokey got some type of mouth
                    disease that made it painful for him to eat and drool all the time. When nothing the vet did worked, we put him to sleep. The same morning my mother left for her deployment to Afghanistan and then I was dropped off at school. Needless
                    to say, I cried almost the entire day and freaked out my teachers. </p>

                <h2>Freckles</h2>
                <p>Freckles was a plump pear shaped black calico cat. She seriously had the smallest head attached to a massive body. I never heard her meow and she generally kept to herself. Freckles got some illness that caused her to waste away until
                    she got unbelievably skinny and passed away one day.</p>

                <h2>Mo</h2>
                <p>Mo was a huge regal long haired dark tabby cat. His paws were massive and he loved to play in the snow. We called him Mo for the 'M' marking on his forehead. My brothers and I actually can't remember what happened to Mo.</p>

                <a name="bear"></a>
                <h2>Bear</h2>
                <p>Bear was such a loving and playful cat. He was a beautiful long haired black cat with a tail that looked like a magnificent plume. The strange thing about Bear's death, is his death is still unconfirmed. Bear was an inside cat and got
                    out one day and didn't come back in. A couple months later I found him in the bushes and he had gone feral with the wildest looking eyes. Bear had obviously seen and been through some things, liked he'd just come back from kitty 'Nam
                    or something. He ran away when I tried to get close to pet him, and we never saw him again after that.</p>

                <h2>Nicky</h2>
                <p>Possibly the dumbest cat we've ever owned. This cat had no sense of self-preservation and would regularly walk up to nuzzle and rub up against dogs that had recently attacked him or legitimately tried to eat him. After a while, dogs knew
                    something was obviously off with Nicky and did not try to eat him. Surprisingly, Nicky died when he was about 17 from natural causes.</p>

                <h2>Andy</h2>
                <p>He was Nicky's twin brother, and he obviously got all of the brains and charm out of the two of them. He was my Dad's favorite and lived to the ripe age of 18 before it was time to put him down.</p>

                <h2>George</h2>
                <p>He was the loudest cat I've ever met. George demonstrated the word "caterwauling" perfectly. Originally a neighborhood tom cat, George decided he had had enough of hard living on the streets and literally moved into our house one day and
                    never left. He was very affectionate, to the point of annoying, but overall a good cat. George lived to be a very old cat, but just as covertly came to our house, he quietly slipped out of the house one day and never came back.</p>
